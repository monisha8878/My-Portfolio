                        <p class="description_project"><br><br>
This was one of the most hands-on and exciting projects I‚Äôve worked on. <br> <br>We developed a working prototype of a library book retrieval system that could move in 2D ‚Äî horizontally and vertically ‚Äî to fetch books from fixed shelf locations. I used an Arduino along with stepper motors and lead screw mechanisms to guide the arm‚Äôs precise motion along the X and Y axes.
<br> <br> It was a blend of mechanical design, electronics, and programming, and it taught me a lot about real-world motion control, circuit integration, and coordinating hardware through code. Programming the system to interpret shelf positions and map them to physical movement was particularly satisfying!

To strengthen my grasp of C++ fundamentals, I created a command-line application that allows users to manage a list of integers interactively.<br><br> The menu-driven interface uses switch-case and modular functions, offering operations like adding numbers, calculating basic stats (like sum, mean), and modifying the list , all with proper input validation.<br><br>
This project helped me reinforce my understanding of control structures, vector manipulation, and user-friendly CLI design. It was a small but effective way to apply what I was learning in a structured way.</p>

This is the very site you're viewing! I designed and built my personal portfolio from scratch using HTML and CSS, aiming for a minimal yet expressive look.<br><br>  The goal was to introduce myself, showcase my projects and learning, and experiment with real-world layout building.<br><br>

This project marked my first deep dive into machine learning. I used scikit-learn to build and evaluate both a decision tree classifier (for the Heart Disease dataset) and a regressor (for the Airfoil Self-Noise dataset).<br> <br>
I focused on understanding how decision trees split data, handled overfitting using pruning techniques, and tuned hyperparameters like max depth and min samples.<br> <br>  The entire process ‚Äî from loading and preprocessing the data to training, evaluating, and visualizing model performance ‚Äî gave me solid hands-on experience with ML pipelines.

        Took the initiative to lead a team at Shipathon, where I was responsible for planning and assigning roles based on individual strengths. Unfortunately, due to unforeseen personal reasons, my team members had to withdraw early in the event. Instead of backing out, I chose to continue alone.
    I independently designed and developed the entire project‚Äîmy first ever website that converted audio to notes ‚Äîmanaging everything from ideation, frontend UI/UX design, to coding and final deployment. This experience not only strengthened my technical skills under pressure but also taught me how to adapt quickly, stay committed, and deliver results even when plans fall apart.
