# Personal Portfolio Website
# Live Site  - https://monisha8878.github.io/My-Portfolio/ 

This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website ‚Äî a space where I introduce myself, showcase my projects, and provide ways to connect with me. The goal of this website is to build a digital identity that reflects my journey, skills, and interests in the tech world.

## About the Project

This portfolio was built using **HTML** and **CSS**( and was initially created by following a YouTube tutorial). The tutorial served as a great foundation, helping me understand the structure and styling of a clean and professional-looking website.

While the layout and design are based on the tutorial, I‚Äôm gradually customizing it to reflect my personal style. I'm learning a lot in the process and planning to make it more unique and dynamic over time.

##  Current Status

- ‚úÖ **Desktop version** is complete and fully functional.
- üì± **Mobile responsiveness** is a work in progress ‚Äî I'm actively improving the layout for smaller screens.
- üåü Future updates will include smoother transitions, small interactive elements, and overall polish.

## üîß Technologies Used

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**

##  Purpose

This website serves as:
- A live resume to share with recruiters, peers, and collaborators
- A showcase of my projects, interests, and journey
- A hands-on learning project as I explore frontend development
